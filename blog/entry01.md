Over the past few weeks I've been researching and thinkering to determine which tool I want to use for my freedom project. I am  currently on step 1 of the **Engineering Design Process: Defining the Tool**. As a result of all of my research, I decided to use Unity as my tool to create a combat game where players gets to pick whatever character that's available. 

The first thing I did is setting up everything like creating a unity account and installing the unity hub which is a place to manage your projects. After that I tried to understand the basic of unity and also explore the unity editor using this [website](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/explore-the-unity-editor-1#6273f00fedbc2a7f158cc1ef). From this website I learned that each tool corresponds to the QWERTY keys. 
* Q corresponds to the Hand tool, to pan your view
* W corresponds to the Move tool, to select and change position
* E: corresponds to the Rotate tool, to select and rotate
* R: corresponds to the Scale tool, to select and change size
* T: corresponds to the Rect Transform tool, to scale in 2D
* Y: corresponds to theTransform tool, to move, scale, and rotate with one Gizmo

After I got used to the editor screen, I tried to create game objects. I first created a sphere and used the scale tool to change it size. Then I tried to add some component to the sphere so it can actually do something. I followed the tutorial on this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@IndividualKex). After watching some tutorials I added a component named Rigidbody so the sphere will have physics and fall down when you press play. Then I added a floor so that the sphere doesn't go through the map. 



For skills, I think I've learned **Problem decomposition** and **How to Google**. When I was researching and learning unity, I break up my tasks into parts. For the first part I need to learn how to set up unity correctly, and then learn about the fundemental. After doing all of that I can start tinkering and creating stuff. Also when I was searching for information, the command ctrl+f saved me a lot of time because it allows me to find the information I needed by selecting the words I typed.
