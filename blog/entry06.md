# Entry 6
##### 6/5/24

My freedom project is completed and I have given my elevator pitch in the expo and presented my product in class. This means that I am on the last step of the **Engineering Design Process**(EDP), **communicating the result**. My elevator pitch and presentation went pretty well and I had many takeaways. When I was giving my elevator pitch which I wrote inside my [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8inEUt3uzffGJanXKtgi2Jjray_xtJ820D2MqCGakg/edit#heading=h.6o1f62qg6jz9), to the judges I got a little nervous and began to stutter. That caused me to go over the one minute timer by a few second and I still want to talk about the future plans I have for my game. My elevator pitch would have gone better if I practiced to myself multiple times and overcome the nervouness of presenting to people. After I given my elevator pitch, I went to see the pitches from my peers. Listening to other people's elevator pitches made me notice some mistakes I had because they also made the same mistake. This gave me an idea on what area should I target to improve on. 

The presentation I did during class went better than I expected. I put a lot of efforts into my [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xoMzhUCH_xIpEmSuwpfXV59VLkgQqyriPU0Uqzck0qo/edit#slide=id.g2ddc7ac0a81_0_1) and I practiced beforehand. I did a lot better than my previous years and the only area that need improvement was my presence. Not giving enough eye contact has been an issue that I made in almost every one of my presentation. Therefore, I should really target that specific area to improve on.

As for skills, I think I've learned **Growth Mindset** and **Embracing Failure**. Although I didn't get a full score on my presentation, I did not get discouraged. Instead, the feedbacks that I recieved motivates me to do better next time. I am always looking forward to opportunities to improve my presenting skills and accept the feedbacks because I know it can help me improve myself.
