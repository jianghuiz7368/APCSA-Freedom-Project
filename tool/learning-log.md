10/23/23: Brainstorming
* Looked up example games that were created using unity.
* I used the example games I saw as a inspiration on what I want my project to be like.





10/27/23: Setting up
* Today I started to look for tutorials on Unity. I first used this [website](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/install-the-unity-hub-and-editor#) to install unity into the computer and set up my unity account
* Installed UnityHub: a place for managing Unity projects, installing Editor versions, licensing, and installing add-on components.
* Followed the tutorial on this [website](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/get-ready-for-unity-essentials?pathwayId=5f7bcab4edbc2a0023e9c38f&missionId=5f77cc6bedbc2a4a1dbddc46&projectId=612f9602edbc2a1b588a3af3#612f5ac2edbc2a1b5806927e) to learn about Unity and add my first project.



10/29/23: Tinkering
* When I first opened up the editor screen, I was confused due to all of the buttons on the screen.
* This [website](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/get-started-in-the-unity-editor?labelRequired=true&pathwayId=5f7bcab4edbc2a0023e9c38f&missionId=5f77cc6bedbc2a4a1dbddc46&projectId=612f5bfdedbc2a1b4376ce65#6375344eedbc2a3b09474963) teached me how to add 3D shapes like cubes and spheres.
* I tried to change the size of the shape, moving it around and rotating it with my mouse.
* I was really confused on how to add code to the shapes that I created so I went back to the website and found a beginner script tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=Z0Z7xc18CcA&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.unity.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.unity.com&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjM4NTE&feature=emb_title) and in the video I saw him adding a script file to a cube so I followed what he did and I sucessfully added a empty file where I can write my script for my scene.
* You will use the Package Manager window to install, remove, and update packages that add functionality to the Unity Editor. 
* A useful feature of the Package Manager is the My Assets section, which catalogs assets you have imported from other sources.
* You have to import the documentation into your package manager in order to use that specific function.
