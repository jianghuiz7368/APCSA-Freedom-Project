10/27/23: Setting up
* Today I started to look for tutorials on Unity. I first used this [website](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/install-the-unity-hub-and-editor#) to install unity into the computer and set up my unity account
* Installed UnityHub: a place for managing Unity projects, installing Editor versions, licensing, and installing add-on components.
* Followed the tutorial on this [website](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/get-ready-for-unity-essentials?pathwayId=5f7bcab4edbc2a0023e9c38f&missionId=5f77cc6bedbc2a4a1dbddc46&projectId=612f9602edbc2a1b588a3af3#612f5ac2edbc2a1b5806927e) to learn about Unity and add my first project.



10/29/23: Tinkering
* When I first opened up the editor screen, I was confused due to all of the buttons on the screen.
* This [website](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/get-started-in-the-unity-editor?labelRequired=true&pathwayId=5f7bcab4edbc2a0023e9c38f&missionId=5f77cc6bedbc2a4a1dbddc46&projectId=612f5bfdedbc2a1b4376ce65#6375344eedbc2a3b09474963) teached me how to add 3D shapes like cubes and spheres.
